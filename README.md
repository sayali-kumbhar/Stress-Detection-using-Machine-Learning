# Stress-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
The model used in this project is BernoulliNB.<br>
The reason behind choosing this model is this problem is binary classification problem(Stress or No Stress),BernoulliNB is part of Naive Bayes.<br>
it is based on Bernoulli Distribution which accepts only binary values i.e 0 or 1.<br>
this model gives the accuracy on train data is 91% and on test data is 74% <br>
for improving the accuracy of this model we need to add more data into dataset.
